# Old-Exile-Files
My files from an old exile server i never fully finished feel free to use them as a learning tool or as a framework to get you server started the map is currently set to esseker using the Esseker Fixed mod.
|
I have also included the 3DEN plugin for exile so you can edit the traders and such easier.

Linked above is the mission file and an arma mods preset that is used. You can drag the mods to the arma launcher to auto subcribe to them as needed.

If you have any questions feel free to open up an issue and i will try to help you as best as i can.
